# 🛠️ **Intro to BASIC**

Welcome to **BASICutils**, a special collection of programs that takes you back to my early coding days in middle school. These were my very first attempts at coding – back when I was an 11-to-13-year-old who had just discovered the thrill of making things happen with lines of code. 

## Project Overview
**BASICutils** is a series of small but mighty programs, each written with curiosity, creativity, and a beginner’s love for experimentation. From calculators to pseudo-hacking scripts, this toolkit captures my earliest programming projects, proudly built with BASIC.

*Warning:* Be prepared for quirky code, a few grammar slips, and comments that might make you smile. But hey, it’s all part of the charm! 😉

## Features
- **Classic Retro Coding:** BASIC language, retro vibes – just like the good old days of coding.
- **Simple, Fun Utilities:** You’ll find programs for quick calculations, games, and yes, even some early “hacking” simulations.
- **Unfiltered Creativity:** No frameworks or libraries here – just raw, unfiltered code from my younger self.

## Installation
No complex setup required! Simply download the files and run them in any BASIC-compatible interpreter. The nostalgia and memories are included free of charge.

## Disclaimer
These programs represent my earliest steps in coding, and while they're a bit rough around the edges, they hold a lot of heart. BASICutils is a time capsule of pure, unpolished enthusiasm – and I hope you enjoy this glimpse into my coding journey as much as I enjoyed creating it.

Thanks for stopping by and for giving these early efforts a look. Coding has come a long way since middle school, but BASICutils will always have a special place in my heart!

Happy Coding!
